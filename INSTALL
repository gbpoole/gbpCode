Installing gbpCode
------------------

To install gbpCode, you need to do the following things:

1) Install gsl

2) Install fftw (and optionally, sprng)

3) Clone a copy of this repository using the command 'git clone ...'

4) Edit the Makefile.libs file in the following way:
> cp Makefile.libs Makefile.mylibs (This way, if you update the repo, this will not need to be redone every time)
> Change the paths to the appropriate library locations on your system.

5) Add the following lines to your .cshrc:
setenv GBP_SRC  ${HOME}'/myCode/'
source ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.gbpCode
setenv PATH            ${PATH}:${GBP_BIN}
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${GBP_LIB}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

If you don't like the default behavior of .cshrc.gbpCode, you can copy the commands in it to your .cshrc file and edit them as you wish.

6) Source your .cshrc

7) Compile the code:
> cd $GBP_SRC
> make

8) If you want an mpi compile, you should then type:
> make clean
> make USE_MPI=1
