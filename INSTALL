INSTALL GUIDE FOR gbpCode AND ITS PACKAGES
==========================================

 ***MAC USERS: If you are running OSX-bash, you will want to fix a bug in the
               OSX version of echo.  You can do so with the following commands:

   > sudo port install bash
   > sudo mv /bin/bash /bin/bash.old
   > sudo mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.old
   > sudo ln /opt/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
   > sudo ln /opt/local/bin/bash /bin/sh

Installing the needed libraries
===============================

To install gbpCode, you need to install several libraries (if you haven't already).  Personally, I place all of these
in the directory $GBP_SRC/3rd_Party ($GBP_SRC should be set in your .cshrc; see below), but they can be wherever you wish.  You just
need to edit your .cshrc.myCode (or .bashrc.myCode) file appropriately (again, see below).  

PRESENTLY, GSL, FFTW and CFITSIO ALL NEED TO BE INSTALLED.

If these libraries are already installed, you will have to find the paths to them.  If they are not, 
here's some instructions on where to get them and how to install them (if you have already
configured and sourced your .cshrc/.bashrc as described below, you can use these commads as is, otherwise
you will have to change all the ${GBP_XXX_DIR} references to the paths where you want each library
installed, and then make sure that you use these same paths later when you configure your .cshrc/.bashrc 
as described in the 'Installing gbpCode' section below):

1) Install GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/):
   -----------
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_GSL_DIR}
> make
> make install

2) Install FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/download.html):
   ------------
Make sure you get version 2.  Version 3 does not support MPI.

The way gbpCode is set up at present, you need 2 separate compiles (one for single precision, one
for double) of FFTW for both serial and MPI (if you are using it).  To get all of these you need to do 
the following from your FFTW source code directory:

> make clean
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --enable-float --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> make install
> make clean
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> history
> make install
> make clean

And if you want to use MPI:

> make clean
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --enable-float --enable-mpi --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> make install
> make clean
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --enable-mpi --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> history
> make install
> make clean

3) Install CFITSIO (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/):
   ---------------
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_CFITSIO_DIR}
> make
> make install

4) Install Python (semi-optional):
   --------------
Several gbpCode packages use python for plotting, etc.  You will need to have python installed
in these cases.  This can be a bit of a pain and really varries from system-to-system, so
I will leave you to your own devices to figure this out.

5) Install MPI (optional; eg. http://www.open-mpi.org/):
   -----------
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_MPI_DIR}
> make
> make install

6) Install Valgrind (optional; http://valgrind.org/downloads/):
   ----------------
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_VALGRIND_DIR}
> make
> make install

7) Install SPRNG (optional; http://sprng.fsu.edu/):
   -------------
This is needed for large parallel runs to avoid periodicity in RNG streams.  It is really tough
to compile and GENERALLY NOT NEEDED.  Make sure you use version 1 if you're brave enough to try
to compile it.


Installing gbpCode
==================

1) Clone a copy of this repository using the command 'git clone git@green.ssi.swin.edu.au:gbpCode.git'

2) In the gbpCode directory (referred to as ${GBP_SRC} here), create a .cshrc.myCode (or .bashrc.myCode) file from 
   ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.myCode (or ${GBP_SRC}/.bashrc.myCode) as described in a) below, edit it as described in b) and 
   source it in your .cshrc (or .bashrc) as described in c):

  a) copy ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.gbpCode to ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.myCode (SO THE FILE DOESN"T GET OVERWRITTEN NEXT TIME YOU PULL FROM THE REPO!)
  b) EDIT .cshrc.myCode (or .bashrc.myCode); set the USE_XXX variables to the default values you want to use.  You can change them when
     you compile by passing different values to make.  For example, if you have USE_MPI=0 by default, you can compile with MPI with
     the command 'make USE_MPI=1'.  For each USE_XXX flag that you anticipate using, you have to supply the path to the library
     in the GBP_XXX_DIR variable.  Make sure that this directory is where the 'lib' and 'include' directories for the library sit.
     SEE THE FILE FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS.

** n.b.: Presently, dependancies are not really enforced very well ... so the only libraries that are optional are SPRNG, MPI and Valgrind.

  c) Add the following lines to your .cshrc (or their equivilant in .bashrc if you use bash; eg. assuming you cloned the repo in ${HOME}):
    > setenv GBP_SRC  ${HOME}'/gbpCode/' 
    > source ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.myCode

3) Before proceeding to use gbpCode for the first time, make sure you source your new .cshrc

4) Compile the code:
> cd $GBP_SRC
> make

5) If you want an mpi compile, you should then type:
> make clean
> make USE_MPI=1

n.b.: MPI versions of executables can be run using the 'run_mpi' script that gets installed 
      in $GBP_BIN.  Run it with no arguments to get the syntax.

Installing additional packages:
==============================

gbpCode was designed so that you can add packages to it.  Once you have gbpCode installed and compiling correctly,
it is trivial to add additional packages to it.

If you add more packages to gbpCode, you should install them in the following way (using the package gbpXXXX as an example):

1) FROM THE $GBP_SRC/gbpPkgs directory, make a clone of the package's repository:
> cd $GBP_SRC/gbpPkgs
> git clone git@green.ssi.swin.edu.au:gbpXXXX.git

2) Create a Makefile.mylocal file in the gbpPkgs directory and edit it::

  a) cd $GBP_SRC/gbpPkgs
  b) cp Makefile.local Makefile.mylocal (if you haven't already done so)
  c) Edit this Makefile.mylocal file, adding gbpXXXX to the end of the SUBDIRS list

n.b.: the gbpCode makefile always uses Makefile.mylocal instead of Makefile.local, if it exists.
      Makefile.mylocal will not get overwritten the next time you pull from the repo!

Now, everytime you recompile gbpCode (after an update for example) it will also 
recompile all your additional packages to make sure that everything is compatible 
and properly linked.

3) Compile your packages:
> cd $GBP_SRC/gbpPkgs
> make clean
> make

If you want MPI versions, then also do the following:
> make clean
> make USE_MPI=1
