INSTALL GUIDE FOR gbpCode AND ITS PACKAGES
==========================================

Installing the needed libraries
-------------------------------

To install gbpCode, you need to install several libraries (if you haven't already):

1) Install MPI (optional):
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_MPI}
> make
> make install

2) Install gsl:
> ./configure prefix=${GBP_GSL_DIR}
> make
> make install

3) Install fftw (make sure that you compile both single & double precision, turn prefixes on and enable mpi if you want it):
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --enable-float --enable-mpi --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> make install
> make clean
> ./configure --enable-type-prefix --enable-mpi --prefix=${GBP_FFTW_DIR}
> make
> history
> make install

4) Install sprng (optional; needed for large parallel runs to avoid periodicity in RNG streams)

Installing gbpCode
------------------

1) Clone a copy of this repository using the command 'git clone gbpCode.git'

2) Edit the Makefile.libs file in the following way:
> cp Makefile.libs Makefile.mylibs
> Change the paths (GBP_GSL_DIR, GBP_FFTW_DIR, etc) in Makefile.mylibs to the appropriate library locations on your system.

n.b.: By making a copy of Makefile.mylibs in this way, it will always be used instead of Makefile.libs and won't be
      overwritten if you pull from the repository again to get an updated version of the code.

3) Add the following lines to your .cshrc (eg. assume you cloned the code to your home directory):
> setenv GBP_SRC  ${HOME}'/gbpCode/' 
> source ${GBP_SRC}/.cshrc.gbpCode

n.b.: If you don't like the default behavior of .cshrc.gbpCode, you can copy the commands in to your .cshrc file and edit them as you wish.

4) Source your new .cshrc

5) Compile the code:
> cd $GBP_SRC
> make

6) If you want an mpi compile, you should then type:
> make clean
> make USE_MPI=1

n.b.: MPI versions of executables can be run using the 'run_mpi' script that gets installed 
      in $GBP_BIN.  Run it with no arguments to get the syntax.

Installing additional packages:
-------------------------------

If you add more packages to gbpCode, you should install them in the following way (using gbpPkg as an example):

1) FROM THE $GBP_SRC directory, make a clone of its repository
> cd $GBP_SRC
> git clone gbpPkg.git

2) Createi/edit a Makefile.mylocal file (optional):
> cd $GBP_SRC
> cp Makefile.local Makefile.mylocal
> Edit $GBP_SRC/Makefile.mylocal, adding gbpPkg to the end of the SUBDIRS list

By creating $GBP_SRC/Makefile.mylocal in this way, everytime you compile gbpCode (after 
an update for example) it will also recompile all your additional packages to make sure 
that everything is compatible and properly linked.

3) Compile the code:
> cd $GBP_SRC/gbpPkg
> make USE_MPI=0
> make clean
> make USE_MPI=1


** MAC OSX USERS: The version of 'echo' that comes with OS X does not support the '-n' 
                  option.  In order for the Makefile's output to make sence, you'll 
                  want to correct this by re-installing bash as follows:

> sudo port install bash
> sudo mv /bin/bash /bin/bash.old
> sudo mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.old
> sudo ln /opt/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
> sudo ln /opt/local/bin/bash /bin/sh
