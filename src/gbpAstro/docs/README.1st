All the code in gbpSims assumes that a simulation is stored in 
one directory with the following subdirectories:

   - catalogs
   - grids  
   - halos  
   - run  
   - smooth
   - snapshots  
   - trees

For the assumed file formats stored in each directory (with 
name <DIR>), see the accompanying README.<DIR> file.

Where possible, file formats are standard (or slight tweaks) of
those naturally produced by Gadget & Subfind.
