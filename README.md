# gbpCode

gbpCode is a collection of tools for studying galaxy clustering and collisionless cosmological simulations.

Apologies, but at present there is very little documentation.  Feel free to email me at if you need assistance.

At present, file formats are assumed to be flat binary files.  Simulation snapshots are assumed to be standard Gadget files and halo catalogs are assumed to be similar to the standard output of Subfind.  All assumed file formats are documented in the “gbpCode/gbpPkgs/gbpSims/docs” directory.

Near-future development will focus on providing documentation and abstracting file I/O to facilitate the use of other file formats.
